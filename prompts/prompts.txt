problem statement: 
When a content creator wants to convert his ideas into real videos, he has to brainstorm, search for videos manually, generate captions, and do a lot of micellineous work. I have an idea to develop a bot that completely streamlines the content creation process starting from topic selection to final video output and uploading also. We want to use streamlit for gui. and remember my previous thoughts.



the basic model architecture is like this :
1) an initial prompt with related kewords will be sent to chatgpt and it provides script 
2) we use edgetts to generate a voiceover 
3) we use whisper to generate the timed captions  
4) our python script will search for the video queries suitable for the background of voiceover. 
5) then these prompts will be converted to links 
6) then all these: voiceover audio file, captions, bg video links, and video server name will be given to the render engine. It does all the editing work and provides final output.
and this is not final we want to develop and add make a complete ai content creator
